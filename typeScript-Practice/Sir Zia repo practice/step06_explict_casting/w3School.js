// *** ~~~ ___ Casting ___ ~~~ ***
// Casting is the process of overriding a type.
// *** Casting with as
// https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_casting.php
// A straightforward way to cast a variable is using the as keyword,
//  which will directly change the type of the given variable.
// - - - Example 01
let x = "hello";
console.log(x.length);
//console.log(x.length);// Error : 'x' is of type 'unknown'
// - - - example 02
let x2 = 4;
console.log(x2.length);
// output : undefined
// Casting doesn't actually change the type of the data within the variable
// TypeScript will still attempt to typecheck casts 
// to prevent casts that don't seem correct, 
// for example the following will throw a type error 
// since TypeScript knows casting a string to a number 
// doesn't makes sense without converting the data:
//  - - - Example 03
// console.log(4 as string).length;
// Error : 
// Conversion of type 'number' to type 'string' 
// may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently 
// overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, 
// convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
// *** Casting with <>
// Using <> works the same as casting with as.
// Example 01
let x3 = "Hello";
console.log("casting as <> :", x.length);
// ALERT
// This type of casting will not work with TSX, 
// such as when working on React files.
// *** Force casting
// - - - Example 01
let x4 = "hello";
//console.log(((x4 as unknown) as number).length);
console.log(x4.toFixed);
// return undefined
// ** *** **** Exercise **** *** **
console.log('=======================');
let myVar = "Hello world";
console.log(myVar.length); // method 1
console.log(myVar.length); // method 2
export {};
