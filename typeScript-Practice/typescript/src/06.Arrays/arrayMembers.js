/**
    it can get
    types mostly right, but sometimes its understanding about the types of
    values may be incorrect. Arrays in particular are a source of unsoundness in
    the type system. By default, TypeScript assumes all array member accesses
    return a member of that array, even though in JavaScript, accessing an array
    element with an index greater than the array’s length gives undefined.

/**
    TypeScript intentionally does
    not make sure retrieved array members exist. It sees elements[9001] in
    the code snippet as being type string, not undefined.

// TypeScript does have a --noUncheckedIndexedAccess flag that makes array lookups more
